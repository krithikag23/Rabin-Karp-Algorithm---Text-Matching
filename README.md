## 🧠 About the Rabin-Karp Algorithm

Rabin-Karp is a pattern matching algorithm that uses **hashing** to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text. It is particularly efficient when searching for multiple patterns or when the pattern occurs frequently in the text.

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Average case: O(n + m)  
  - Worst case (with many hash collisions): O(nm)

- **Use Cases**:  
  - Plagiarism detection  
  - DNA sequence analysis  
  - Intrusion detection systems  
  - Pattern matching in large text corpora
