Data structures and algorithms are the heart of programming.
Among the many string matching algorithms, Rabin-Karp is unique for its use of hashing.
This algorithm is efficient when multiple pattern matches are needed.
Streamlit helps in making interactive Python apps easily.
With Rabin-Karp, finding patterns in text becomes both efficient and elegant.
